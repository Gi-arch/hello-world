# hello-world
My first repository

Hi,hello,hey there,
It's Maryam here. I love Mathematics a lot and I have taken a serious interest in technology.
Not my fault, technology is a driving force in the world these days. It makes a lot of things possible and I want to know how it works and improve our way of living by technology.
So, I am currently working towards being a programmer; not too easy though but I love the challenge of learning it.
For now, I think I want to be a data scientist; because it deals with a part of mathematics. 
Thank you.
